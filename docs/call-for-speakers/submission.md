# Submit Your Session

We use sessionize platform for call for speakers, also known as _CFS_ or _CFP_. Submit your sessions [here](https://sessionize.com/kcd-kuala-lumpur-2026) by 28th Feb 2026 11:59pm.

While it is not our intention to provide you with strict instructions on how to prepare your submission, we hope you will take a moment to review the following guidelines that we have put together to help you prepare the best submission possible. To get started, here are three things that you should consider before submitting:

1. What are you hoping to get from your presentation?
2. What do you expect the audience to gain from your presentation?
3. How will your presentation help better the ecosystem?

There are plenty of ways to give a presentation about projects and technologies without focusing on company-specific / vendor-specific features. Remember the things to consider that we mentioned above when submitting your session and think of ways to make it interesting for attendees while still letting you share your experiences, educate the community about an issue, or generate interest on a topic.

## How It Works

1. **Submission**: Submit a proposal for the session by the deadline. You can always edit the submission till the deadline.
2. **Review process**: KCD Kuala Lumpur CFP committee will review all submissions and select speakers based on criteria such as the quality of the topic, relevance and alignment with the event's goals
3. **Confirmation and preparation**: Once selected, the speaker is notified and may begin (or continue) preparing their session according to the guidelines
4. **Complimentary event pass**: One complimentary pass for the event will be provided for each accepted speaker

## Guideline to submit

Refer to [Submission Guideline](./submission-guideline.md), [Session Type](./session-type.md), [Session Category](./session-category.md) and [Session Difficulty Level](./session-difficulty.md)

## How to Give a Great Talk

We want to make sure submitters receive resources to help put together a great submission and if accepted, give the best presentation possible. To help with this, we recommend viewing seasoned speaker Dawn Foster’s in-depth talk on [Getting Over Your Imposter Syndrome to Become a Conference Speaker – Dawn Foster, VMware](https://youtu.be/2I5fYBLCfUA)

## Our Inspiration for This Guideline
We would like to thank CNCF and the KubeCon + CloudNativeCon CFP committee for sharing the [documentation](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/cfp) on how to submit a session. Our guideline is heavily _inspired_ from the forementioned KubeCon + CloudNativeCon documentation
