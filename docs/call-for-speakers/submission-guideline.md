# Submission Guideline

To help us curate a diverse and high-quality program for KCD Kuala Lumpur, please keep the following in mind when submitting your proposal

## Code of Conduct

All speakers are required to adhere to CNCF's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)

## Avoid AI slop

Avoid submitting low-effort, AI-generated proposals. While we don't ban the use of AI, especially since it can be a helpful tool for non-native English speakers, we strongly discourage submissions that appear to be low-quality or clearly [AI-generated slop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop)

## Maximum of 3 submissions per speaker

You may propose up to three different sessions. This allows flexibility while ensuring fairness in the review process

## Choose the appropriate session type and category

Please select the format that best fits your content (refer to [Session Type](./session-type.md) page). Clear session types make it easier for our committee to evaluate your proposal. You should also select the correct content category as listed in [Session Category](./session-category.md)

## Panel sessions require diversity

For panel discussions, we prioritize diverse representation across backgrounds, companies, experience levels, and gender to ensure a richer, more balanced conversation

## Travel support depends on budget

Accommodation and/or flight reimbursement for speakers from Sabah, Sarawak and overseas might be available, subject to our event budget. We will update the details later on.

## Avoid sales pitch

Avoid sales or marketing pitches and discussing unlicensed or potentially closed-source technologies when preparing your proposal; these talks are almost always rejected due to the fact that they take away from the integrity of our event. Make sure your content is open source and vendor neutral

## Attach slides (optional)

Attach slides with your submission as that could help us better understand your session. This is optional, but we highlty encourage you to upload the slides
