# Session Difficulty Level

## Beginner

Beginner sessions are designed for those with **minimal to no prior knowledge of the topic**. These talks focus on the **fundamentals and basic concepts, with minimal use of jargon**. Presenters avoid assuming any technical background and instead offer high-level overviews that introduce key technologies, tools or workflows in simple terms. These sessions aim to build awareness and provide foundational understanding, often using illustrative examples or analogies

## Intermediate

Intermediate sessions assume that attendees have **some experience with the topic at hand**. These talks **delve deeper into practical applications, workflows and tools**, offering real-world examples and often demonstrating how to implement certain technologies. While some jargon is used, it's typically explained as the presentation progresses. The goal here is to help attendees build their skills and gain a more nuanced understanding of the subject

## Advanced

Advanced sessions cater to **highly experienced professionals** with a deep understanding of the subject matter. These talks explore **complex systems, architectural patterns and optimizations**, often focusing on specialized topics such as performance tuning, system design or advanced security techniques. Expect a significant amount of technical jargon and detailed code walkthroughs, as these sessions are designed to deepen knowledge for those already working in the field
