# Financial Support for Speakers

!!! note
    The availability of financial support is tied to the event’s budget. We may need to limit the number of support or adjust the amount accordingly. And this is a **reimbursement program** which means that funds will not be provided upfront, but reimbursed after the event, based on the submitted invoice and receipts. In some cases, the financial support may not cover all costs and it is the responsibility of the speaker to cover any remaining expenses

!!! warning
    In case we couldn't secure enough budget, unfortunately, we won't be able to provide any financial support for the speakers

We are excited to offer conditional **financial support** for speakers from either Sabah/Sarawak or overseas attending our event. This program is designed to help support and facilitate the participation of talented individuals from outside of Peninsular Malaysia. Please note that this financial support is on a **need basis** and contingent on our event's overall budget.
